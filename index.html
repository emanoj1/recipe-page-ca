            <h3>Red Kidney Beans in Coconut Milk</h3>
            <img src="https://unrecipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8550FE07-2094-4F96-A1CA-EB09DF89CC03-1024x768.jpeg" alt="Rajma Curry" style="width:300px;height:250px;">
            <p>Everyone loves a good rajma curry, whether South Asian or not. Normally, milk cream is used in this recipe to give it that restaurant-style “gravy-ness” but I usually use coconut milk. You could use coconut cream also. So, this is how I cooked this classic red kidney bean curry in BULK.

            <h3>Multi-leaf Baked Falafel</h3>
            <img src="https://unrecipes.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3011-768x1024.jpg" alt="Falafel" style="width:300px;height:250px;">
            <p>This is my own favourite recipe in the sense I am using multiple leaves rather than just parsley and I am baking this falafel which is a much healthier option compared to the deep fry.
